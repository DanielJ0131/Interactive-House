# Interactive House Project | HKR

* Course: DA330B - Software Engineering
* Institution: Kristianstad University
* Group 4

## Framework: CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate)

# Project Overview

The Interactive House is an experiment in Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp). The primary goal is to study human-controlled communication with household devices to increase independence and self-control for individuals with disabilities.
This project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals:

* SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being.

* SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.

* SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.

# Subgroups

## Subgroup 1 - Server & Database

* Members: 3

* Role: Central Hub Logic: Responsible for the main communication hub and the database containing authorized users and device registries

* Responsibilities

  * Develop the central house server that coordinates all interactions.

  * Manage the database of authorized users and currently attached units/devices.

## Subgroup 2 - Units

* Members: 3

* Role: Controller Interface: Develops the interaction logic and user interfaces that are informed by the server about available devices.

* Responsibilities:

  * Build web-based AND mobile-style GUIs for observing and controlling devices
    
  * Implement interaction techniques such as touch-screen interfaces
 
## Subgroup 3 - Device Simulation

* Members: 4

* Role: Environment Logic: Responsible for the Virtual House logic that simulates the core state of a standard home.

* Responsibilities:
  
  * Simulate core house functions: light on/off states, alarm systems, and temperature sensors.
    
  * Make the actual logic so that web and mobile can use for their GUI
 
## Subgroup 4 - Free Choice / Innovation

  * Members: 3

  * Role: Motivated Choice: Focuses on advanced simulated devices and accessibility features to increase a person's independence.

  * Responsibilities:

    * Simulation of specific devices: media/music players, coffee machines, microwave ovens, or automated curtains
    
    * Experiment with advanced inputs like speech or gesture recognition.
   
    * Come up with new innovative ideas to our project
   
# Role of Project Manager (PM)

The PM is responsible for the overall execution, leadership, and external representation of the group. PM will also work in one of the subgroups.

* Internal Leadership: Leads the internal project meetings and coordinates between the four development subgroups.

* External Representation: Acts as the primary spokesperson to the customers and super project managers (teachers).

* Formal Accountability: Answers for the project progress during formal bi-weekly meetings, specifically regarding prototypes and the status of results.

* Project Oversight: Exercises control over the project process and ensures the group meets the iterative and incremental milestones of the RUP approach.

* Final Delivery: Manages the final report and ensures all 24 artefacts are finalized and integrated for the final presentation

# Role of Requirements Manager (RM)

The RM focuses on the assistance of the PM and the integrity of the system's technical requirements. RM will also work in one of the subgroups.

* Managerial Assistance: Assists the PM in project control and administrative oversight.

* Requirements Consistency: Ensures that the functional and non-functional requirements consider the project as a whole rather than just isolated subgroups.

* Technical Coordination: Facilitates the negotiation of interfaces and protocols between subgroups to ensure the server can communicate with units and devices.

* Documentation Integrity: Responsible for discussing and answering for the project's requirements documents and artefacts during formal meetings.

* Collaborative Representation: Represents the project alongside the PM in less formal meetings with the teaching staff.

# Mandatory Process Artefacts (24 Total)
## Each of the four subgroups is responsible for maintaining a complete set of these 6 documents:

* Vision Document: Project overview and stakeholder desires
  
* Requirements Document: Functional system requirements.

* Supplementary Requirements: Non-functional quality attributes (Performance, Reliability).

* Project Risks: Identification and mitigation plans for process/product risks.

* Design Document: Software architecture using UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, State).

* V&V and Test Plan: Verification and validation documentation.
