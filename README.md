# 🏠 Interactive House Project | HKR

Course: DA330B - Software Engineering
Institution: Kristianstad University (HKR)

## Framework: CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate)

# Project Overview

The Interactive House is an experiment in Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp). The primary goal is to study human-controlled communication with household devices to increase independence and self-control for individuals with disabilities.
This project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals:

* SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being.

* SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.

* SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.

# Subgroups

## Subgroup 1 - Server & Database

* Members: 3

* Role: Central Hub Logic: Responsible for the main communication hub and the database containing authorized users and device registries

* Responsibilities

  * Develop the central house server that coordinates all interactions.

  * Manage the database of authorized users and currently attached units/devices.

## Subgroup 2 - Units

* Members: 3.

* Role: Controller Interface: Develops the interaction logic and user interfaces that are informed by the server about available devices.

* Responsibilities:

  * Build web-based AND mobile-style GUIs for observing and controlling devices
    
  * Implement interaction techniques such as touch-screen interfaces
 
## Subgroup 3 - Device Simulation

* Members: 4

* Role: Environment Logic: Responsible for the Virtual House logic that simulates the core state of a standard home.

* Responsibilities:
  
  * Simulate core house functions: light on/off states, alarm systems, and temperature sensors.
    
  * Make it look good
 
## Subgroup 4 - Free Choice / Innovation

  * Members: 3.

  * Role: Motivated Choice: Focuses on advanced simulated devices and accessibility features to increase a person's independence.

  * Responsibilities:

    * Simulation of specific devices: media/music players, coffee machines, microwave ovens, or automated curtains
    
    * Experiment with advanced inputs like speech or gesture recognition.
   
    * Come up with new innovative ideas to our project

# Mandatory Process Artefacts (24 Total)
## Each of the four subgroups is responsible for maintaining a complete set of these 6 documents:

* Vision Document: Project overview and stakeholder desires
  
* Requirements Document: Functional system requirements.

* Supplementary Requirements: Non-functional quality attributes (Performance, Reliability).

* Project Risks: Identification and mitigation plans for process/product risks.

* Design Document: Software architecture using UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, State).

* V&V and Test Plan: Verification and validation documentation.
